	I've been doing some research into the Adobe programs - <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" target="blank">Treehouse</a> has a wonderful collection of videos for learning the foundations of Illustrator and Photoshop from the  bottom-up. Mat Helme, who teaches Illustrator Foundations, does a thorough job of explaining every one of the tools available and how to use them. As a total newbie, this was exactly what I needed.

	If you're familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator, you already know the whole deal about vector vs. rastor graphics. This difference is totally fascinating to me and important to understand as a design student. I started with Photoshop tutorials to get my feet wet, since I had some (read: very limited) experience using it to edit photos. It's popular among my photographer friends, who seem to use it mainly as editing software rather than a platform for building art from scratch. While this is a perfectly good application of the program, I wanted to know more about using it in other ways.

	To be honest, I was totally intimidated by Illustrator. Like Photoshop, it was not intuitive for me at all. I really needed someone to say directly, "This is how you do such-and-such, and this is what this tool does."

	Now that I've been following along with the Treehouse lessons, there are so many ways to use this program to actually <em>make</em> things. The course has you design a logo using shapes, color, and type (and also explains best practices of typography in graphic design), and now we're moving into drawing to make custom vector artwork. It's been great so far, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn Illustrator in depth.

<h3>Alisen's Top Tips for Illustrator Beginners:</h3>

    <ul class="post-content indent">
        <li>
        	Memorize basic <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>. Many of them are easy to learn (they become visible when you hover over the tools), and it will speed up your projects.
        </li>
        <li>
        	If you hand-draw an image that you want to convert to a digital file, you can make the layer a <strong>Template</strong> and use it as a <a href="#ill-template">tracing guide</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
        	Use Shift-E and Shift-B to quickly <strong>switch between the Blog Brush and Eraser</strong> when drawing. (I'm telling you, those keyboard shortcuts...)
        </li>
        <li>
        	The <strong>Swatch Tool</strong> contains preset color palettes for a variety of projects, including Kid's Stuff, Earth-tones, and Skin-tones. If you need a little inspiration for a color theme, this is a fun place to look.
        </li>
        <li>
        	Instead of filling an object with a color, you can make your own <strong> custom pattern</strong>, adjusting the size and layout in lots of fun ways.
        </li>
    </ul>
